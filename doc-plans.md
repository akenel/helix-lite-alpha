Since your Helix Platform runs on Docker Compose and has a rich infrastructure, Gatsby (a static site generator) is not a natural fit for showcasing or advertising your platform. Instead, you should use a solution that highlights your infrastructure, features, and usage in a way that’s easy to maintain and interactive if needed.

**Recommended solutions for advertising and documentation:**

---

### 1. **A Modern, Static Documentation Site (but NOT Gatsby)**
- **Docusaurus**: Focused on documentation, easy to set up, supports Markdown, versioning, and has a built-in blog.
  - [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a popular choice for developer-focused projects.
  - You can deploy it on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
- **MkDocs**: Markdown-based, simple, and fast. Great for technical docs, can be themed, and is easy to host anywhere.
- **Hugo**: Fast static site generator, good for documentation and blogs, lots of themes.

---

### 2. **Interactive Landing Page**
- Use **React** (with Vite or Next.js) or **Astro** if you want a more dynamic, modern site.
- These frameworks make it easy to embed demos, code snippets, videos, and showcase your Docker Compose file.

---

### 3. **README and GitHub Pages**
- Start with a well-written, visually appealing `README.md` in your GitHub repo. Add architecture diagrams, usage instructions, and feature highlights.
- Use GitHub Pages to publish Markdown docs or a static site directly from your repo.

---

### 4. **Live Demo/Playground**
- If possible, set up a demo instance of your platform (maybe on a cloud VM), and link to it from your site.
- Embed screenshots, screencasts, or interactive walkthroughs.

---

### **Example Approach for Helix Platform:**

1. **Documentation Site**:  
   - Use Docusaurus or MkDocs.
   - Document your Docker Compose setup, profiles, and how to launch services.
   - Add guides: "Getting Started with Helix", "Profiles Explained", "Core Services", etc.
   - Add architecture diagrams (use Mermaid or draw.io).

2. **Landing Page**:  
   - Use Astro or Vite + React to create a modern site.
   - Explain what Helix does, who it’s for, and its benefits.
   - Highlight core features: integration, profiles, extensibility.
   - Show Docker Compose snippets and usage.

3. **Repository README**:  
   - Make your README a mini homepage: project description, quickstart, badges, and links to docs/demo.

---

### **Why choose these over Gatsby?**
- Gatsby is overkill for documentation and not optimized for infra-heavy, backend-centric projects.
- Docusaurus, MkDocs, and Hugo are easier for technical documentation and have strong plugin ecosystems.
- Modern React frameworks are better for landing pages and interactive showcases.

---

**Summary:**  
For your Docker Compose-based middleware platform, use Docusaurus, MkDocs, Hugo, or a modern React framework for documentation and a landing page. Make sure your README is strong, and consider GitHub Pages or Netlify for hosting. These tools are better suited than Gatsby for your use case.
