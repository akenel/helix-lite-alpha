Company: Urban Gardens - A subscription box service for urban gardening enthusiasts.
Background: Jane founded Urban Gardens 5 years ago after seeing a need for accessible gardening solutions in city apartments. She is passionate about sustainability and community. The business has grown steadily, but Jane is now struggling with customer churn and limited market reach beyond her current city. She is highly active on LinkedIn and is looking for a solution that can help her scale efficiently without losing the personal touch of her brand.
Pain Points:
- High customer churn rate (30% per year).
- Inefficient manual processes for managing customer feedback.
- Difficulty in reaching new demographics (e.g., suburban families, younger professionals).
- Finding it hard to balance daily operations with long-term growth strategy.
- Hesitant to adopt expensive, complex software.
