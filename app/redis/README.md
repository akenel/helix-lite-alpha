Nice catch 🕵️ — you’re absolutely right: Redis can hold onto stale GUIDs/keys even if Postgres and MinIO are clean. If you don’t wipe Redis, your app/workflow might still pull “old state” and confuse things.

Here are the **safe ways to reset Redis** (all equivalent, pick the one you like):

---

### 1. Quick nuke (flush everything)

From your host, run:

```bash
docker exec -it redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
```

* `FLUSHALL` clears **all keys** from all databases.
* If you’re only using this Redis for your app, that’s usually fine.

---

### 2. Just clear current DB

If you want to keep other DBs but wipe the default (db 0):

```bash
docker exec -it redis redis-cli FLUSHDB
```

---

### 3. Wipe by recreating volume (nuclear option)

If you want Redis *completely pristine*, delete its persistent volume and restart:

```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data/redis
docker compose up -d redis
```

This nukes everything Redis has ever stored, then starts fresh.

---

### 4. Inspect first (optional)

To confirm what’s in Redis before wiping:

```bash
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
```

Then inside the CLI:

```redis
KEYS *
```

(⚠️ Don’t run `KEYS *` in huge prod Redis, but for dev it’s fine.)

---

💡 Since you’re testing and already wiped Postgres + MinIO, I’d suggest **Option 1 (`FLUSHALL`)** — quick, guaranteed, and consistent with your “clean slate” reset.

---

👉 Do you want me to draft you a **“reset script”** (bash Make target or standalone script) that wipes Postgres, Redis, and MinIO bucket in one go so you can always start fresh with one command?
